# Advanced Robotics Simulator

## Overview

This project implements a high-fidelity simulator for robotic systems with complex kinematics and dynamics. It includes:

- Kinematics and Dynamics calculations
- Path Planning and Control Algorithms
- Visualization and Collision Detection
- Comprehensive Error Handling and Unit Testing

## Requirements

- C++17
- Eigen (for matrix operations)

## Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
make
```

To build the unit tests, navigate to the 'test' directory and run:

```bash
cd test
make
```

## Running

To run the simulator, execute:

```bash
./simulator
```

To run unit tests, navigate to the 'test' directory and execute:

```bash
cd test
./test_executable
```
